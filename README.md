# Dashcam Object Detection

A Python project that uses YOLO for real-time object detection and classification in dashcam footage.

## Features
- Real-time detection and classification of 70+ common objects (e.g., cars, pedestrians, traffic lights)
- Trained deep learning model achieving over 80% accuracy in real-world dashcam conditions
- Displays bounding boxes and labels on detected objects in live or recorded footage

## Technologies
- Python
- YOLO
- Keras
- OpenCV

## Notes
The project demonstrates the application of deep learning for road scene understanding using dashcam inputs.
